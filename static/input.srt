1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,310
Australia is a fascinating continent. As the driest continent

2
00:00:04,342 --> 00:00:07,974
in the world apart from Antarctica, its no surprise that Australia

3
00:00:08,054 --> 00:00:12,142
is home to the second largest desert of the inhabited earths continents,

4
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:15,678
remaining only behind the Sahara of northern Africa.

5
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:19,422
In scale and scope, the great australian desert

6
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:23,422
spans more than a third of the continent and is larger in size

7
00:00:23,478 --> 00:00:27,160
than the entirety of Kazakhstan. And its partially because of

8
00:00:27,192 --> 00:00:31,304
this desert that Australia itself, despite being the 6th

9
00:00:31,344 --> 00:00:35,312
largest country in the world in terms of land, is only the

10
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:39,040
53rd largest in terms of people, with a modest

11
00:00:39,112 --> 00:00:42,520
population of less than 26 million citizens,

12
00:00:42,632 --> 00:00:46,520
were around the same size as North Korea. But within this

13
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:50,120
vast, inhospitable and empty desert,

14
00:00:50,232 --> 00:00:53,912
at the precise geographic center of the australian

15
00:00:53,968 --> 00:00:57,826
continent, exists a surprising and relatively

16
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,774
unknown secret of enormous geopolitical

17
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:05,302
importance. One of the largest overseas

18
00:01:05,358 --> 00:01:08,342
military bases of the United States of America,

19
00:01:08,438 --> 00:01:12,430
operated by the Central Intelligence Agency, the national Security Administration,

20
00:01:12,582 --> 00:01:16,614
and the National Reconnaissance Office. With a full 800 combined

21
00:01:16,694 --> 00:01:20,350
personnel, the base is located nearby to the small australian

22
00:01:20,382 --> 00:01:24,438
town of Alice Springs, population just 26,000

23
00:01:24,526 --> 00:01:28,422
or so people. But besides for that, there is no larger

24
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:31,476
town that exists anywhere, anywhere nearby to this base,

25
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,852
within a zone of about 700,000 km²,

26
00:01:35,988 --> 00:01:39,308
roughly equivalent in area to the us state of Texas.

27
00:01:39,436 --> 00:01:43,588
So to say that this american intelligence base, with hundreds of american

28
00:01:43,676 --> 00:01:47,636
intelligence officers operating within the dead center of Australia

29
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,380
is a remote location would be an incredible understatement.

30
00:01:52,532 --> 00:01:55,756
From the small australian town of Alice Springs, if you take

31
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,100
a short drive just ten minutes or so to the southwest,

32
00:01:59,212 --> 00:02:02,850
youll quickly run into various threatening signs,

33
00:02:02,882 --> 00:02:06,258
like this one, warning you to turn your car around and proceed no

34
00:02:06,306 --> 00:02:10,334
further, or else face some vague consequences.

35
00:02:10,634 --> 00:02:14,378
Just beyond these signs is, of course, the top secret

36
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:18,266
joint intelligence base of Pine Gap, run by both the american

37
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,970
and australian governments. And unless youve watched the Netflix series about

38
00:02:22,002 --> 00:02:25,506
this base going under the same name, youve probably never even heard

39
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,560
of this place, or knew that such an important, important american operation

40
00:02:29,632 --> 00:02:33,696
existed in the middle of the australian outback and

41
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,376
going under the more official codename of Project Rainfall.

42
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,472
It has a very long and mysterious history

43
00:02:41,568 --> 00:02:45,312
here, going back decades into the past. You see,

44
00:02:45,408 --> 00:02:49,288
as the global cold war between the United States and the Soviet Union

45
00:02:49,376 --> 00:02:53,032
intensified during the 1960s, both nations began

46
00:02:53,088 --> 00:02:56,586
sending up satellites into space with the launching of the earliest

47
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,722
intelligence gathering satellites. There was a recognition

48
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:03,930
that real time command and control over these platforms were necessary,

49
00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:07,074
and data collection to monitor geopolitical adversaries

50
00:03:07,114 --> 00:03:10,810
from afar was required. An american base to operate these

51
00:03:10,882 --> 00:03:13,986
american intelligence and spy satellites operating over the planets

52
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,810
eastern hemisphere could have theoretically been constructed anywhere but

53
00:03:17,842 --> 00:03:21,130
the precise geographic center of the australian

54
00:03:21,162 --> 00:03:25,602
continent was chosen for a number of strategically important factors.

55
00:03:25,778 --> 00:03:29,650
First, the sheer isolation of such a base

56
00:03:29,722 --> 00:03:33,994
deep within the continental interior of Australia, more than 900

57
00:03:34,074 --> 00:03:37,490
km away from the nearest coastline, ensured that

58
00:03:37,562 --> 00:03:41,690
any potential spy ships from foreign nations passing around would

59
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:45,314
be incapable of intercepting any of the signals coming down

60
00:03:45,354 --> 00:03:48,730
to the base from the satellites. Second, the base would be

61
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:52,018
located deep within Australia, a country who was very

62
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:56,106
friendly and allied towards the United States and far away

63
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:00,058
from any major australian population centers around the coasts.

64
00:04:00,146 --> 00:04:03,642
And third, and perhaps most importantly, the location

65
00:04:03,698 --> 00:04:07,554
where the station would be built required the base of the floor and surrounding

66
00:04:07,594 --> 00:04:11,706
hills to not exceed six degrees at the precise

67
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:15,178
coordinates of pine gaps location in the center of Australia

68
00:04:15,306 --> 00:04:19,042
at latitude 23.8 degrees south and longitude

69
00:04:19,098 --> 00:04:22,098
133.74 degrees east.

70
00:04:22,186 --> 00:04:26,074
The ability would be gained to allow for high connectivity with satellites

71
00:04:26,114 --> 00:04:29,832
stationed as far as 60 degrees east and as far

72
00:04:29,928 --> 00:04:32,992
east as 153 degrees west,

73
00:04:33,128 --> 00:04:36,720
effectively covering the entirety of China, North Korea,

74
00:04:36,792 --> 00:04:40,272
the indian subcontinent, and a significant portion

75
00:04:40,328 --> 00:04:44,224
of the then Soviet Union. In short, it was a very

76
00:04:44,344 --> 00:04:47,800
logically chosen location to construct a satellite intelligence base

77
00:04:47,832 --> 00:04:51,192
at. And as a result, by late 1966,

78
00:04:51,248 --> 00:04:54,920
the american and australian government signed a treaty calling for the

79
00:04:54,952 --> 00:04:58,642
creation of a us satellite surveillance base in Australia,

80
00:04:58,808 --> 00:05:02,062
which eventually became the modern pine gap,

81
00:05:02,118 --> 00:05:05,470
where operations began in 1970 with the relocation

82
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:09,390
of hundreds of american families to the center of the outback.

83
00:05:09,502 --> 00:05:12,830
But there was another, larger intelligence alliance

84
00:05:12,862 --> 00:05:16,286
at work here that led to the creation of the base as well known as

85
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,526
the Five Eyes. This is an intelligence alliance of

86
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,798
the five major english speaking democracies around the world

87
00:05:22,846 --> 00:05:26,198
of the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia,

88
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:30,062
and New Zealand. Created during the fires of the Second World

89
00:05:30,118 --> 00:05:33,374
War and expanded during the Cold War, this alliance

90
00:05:33,414 --> 00:05:37,326
structure enables all member states intelligence agencies to easily

91
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:41,142
cooperate with each other and share all of their worldwide

92
00:05:41,238 --> 00:05:44,886
data. As the cold War continued to rage and new threats

93
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,726
to the United States emerged. Like the Peoples Republic of China,

94
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:51,814
Vietnam, and later on, Iraq and Afghanistan, Pine Gap

95
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:56,478
continued to play a pivotal role in providing intelligence while dramatically

96
00:05:56,566 --> 00:06:00,246
growing in size to the point where today it boasts nearly

97
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:03,740
440 separate antennas across the site and has operated

98
00:06:03,812 --> 00:06:07,364
at least nine geosynchronous satellites owned by various

99
00:06:07,444 --> 00:06:10,820
us spy agencies over the past 45 years.

100
00:06:10,932 --> 00:06:14,708
Now, what makes these kinds of satellites uniquely well suited to

101
00:06:14,716 --> 00:06:18,428
the mission of intelligence gathering is that within a geosynchronous

102
00:06:18,476 --> 00:06:21,820
orbit, they travel in the same direction as the earths

103
00:06:21,852 --> 00:06:25,900
rotation and therefore retain the exact same orbital

104
00:06:25,972 --> 00:06:29,844
period as that of the earths rotation, which effectively just means

105
00:06:29,884 --> 00:06:33,202
that they view the exact same portion of the surface

106
00:06:33,258 --> 00:06:37,362
at all times, as if theyre sort of fixed in position on

107
00:06:37,378 --> 00:06:40,914
the map. This is in stark contrast to satellites that operate

108
00:06:40,954 --> 00:06:44,538
in lower Earth orbits which circle around the planet, often multiple

109
00:06:44,586 --> 00:06:47,970
times a day, and move at a relative pace much

110
00:06:48,042 --> 00:06:51,298
faster. One of the unique advantages of a geosynchronous

111
00:06:51,346 --> 00:06:54,898
orbit for a spy satellite is that within this range,

112
00:06:54,986 --> 00:06:58,426
it can see an enormous amount of the earths surface all

113
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:01,850
at once. In fact, if you were to go and do all the math and

114
00:07:01,882 --> 00:07:05,762
run the calculations for this, it turns out to be just a tad

115
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:10,210
bit less than half of the earths entire surface.

116
00:07:10,362 --> 00:07:13,938
This, of course, makes it incredibly easy for the spy

117
00:07:13,986 --> 00:07:17,474
satellite above to gather a vast amount of

118
00:07:17,514 --> 00:07:21,530
information from a very large area beneath it. And so

119
00:07:21,602 --> 00:07:25,154
today there are three of these types of geosynchronous

120
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:29,118
spy satellites known to be operated from pine gap

121
00:07:29,206 --> 00:07:33,110
all at the same line of latitude. Orion five above

122
00:07:33,142 --> 00:07:36,486
the western Indian Ocean, Orion seven at the western tip

123
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,934
of the indonesian island of Sumatra and Orion three

124
00:07:40,054 --> 00:07:43,110
just west of the indonesian island of Sulawesi.

125
00:07:43,222 --> 00:07:46,462
Each of these three geosynchronous satellites sit in

126
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:49,910
an altitude of about 36,000 km above

127
00:07:49,942 --> 00:07:53,642
the earths surface at these precisely coordinates.

128
00:07:53,738 --> 00:07:57,778
And they each collect an incredibly wide range of electronic

129
00:07:57,826 --> 00:08:01,450
signals from the earths surface beneath them, like radio communications,

130
00:08:01,562 --> 00:08:05,330
radar emissions, microwave transmissions, missile telemetry,

131
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:09,474
satellite and cell phone transmissions, and even more. These three

132
00:08:09,554 --> 00:08:12,922
satellites effectively grant american intelligence agencies,

133
00:08:12,978 --> 00:08:17,130
and therefore the intelligence of all the five Eyes member states,

134
00:08:17,242 --> 00:08:20,776
an incredible degree of satellite coverage across

135
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:25,008
every single area of modern US critical strategic

136
00:08:25,056 --> 00:08:28,136
concern from western Africa, across the Middle East,

137
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,144
Ukraine, Russia, Iran, Afghanistan,

138
00:08:31,304 --> 00:08:34,944
China and North Korea. More than half of the earths

139
00:08:34,984 --> 00:08:39,000
surface outside of the polar regions. Once data from these regions

140
00:08:39,032 --> 00:08:42,976
is received by the satellites, their information is relayed via a signal

141
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,456
back to the pine gap base in the center of Australia and then

142
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,834
disseminated from there towards the various intelligence agencies

143
00:08:49,874 --> 00:08:53,794
of the five Eyes member states like the american CIA and

144
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:57,674
british Mi six. And while controversial at times,

145
00:08:57,794 --> 00:09:01,618
the american intelligence capabilities that are granted by satellite sites

146
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:05,402
around the world like pine Gap are unmatched

147
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:08,402
by any other intelligence agency in the world.

148
00:09:08,538 --> 00:09:12,234
And while most of what these satellites do is top secret

149
00:09:12,354 --> 00:09:16,698
and highly classified, we all know that launching those satellites,

150
00:09:16,746 --> 00:09:21,122
maintaining them up there and gathering all that data from the surface below

151
00:09:21,258 --> 00:09:25,186
is an incredibly difficult feat to accomplish.

152
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,922
And if youre anything like me, then youre probably curious how

153
00:09:28,978 --> 00:09:32,762
satellites like these actually work. And more to the point,

154
00:09:32,898 --> 00:09:36,674
how anything actually works. Understanding the difficult

155
00:09:36,714 --> 00:09:40,546
to understand is the very essence of STEM fields.

156
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:44,490
But for a lot of us and myself included. STEM subjects like

157
00:09:44,522 --> 00:09:48,642
engineering and math and make this seemingly impossible possible

158
00:09:48,818 --> 00:09:52,134
